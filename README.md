# WorldBuilding
Worldbuilding is a website hobby project that contains simple information on making a wonderful world full of different ideas, characters and backgrounds. 

## Motivation
The fantasy genre has always been a selling point for movies, tv, books, videogames and the whole media industry. Growing up, there is always something that latches onto you and this was it for me. This website was built on the fascination of fiction and the intention of continuing the genre. 

## Getting Started
Worldbuilding is a standalone website and does not need any downloads or accounts. The navigation for the site is primarily found in the footer. 

### Navigating the Website
##### The website is divided into 3 pages that contains different information and functionalities of the website. 
* "Home" is where the site synopsis can be found. 
* "Types" is where a user can view the different methods to worldbuilding.  It contains both "top-down" and "bottom-up" perspectives and explains the differences between them. 
* "CharacterGen" is the page that contains the character generator. The five buttons at the top of the page allow for a customized charcater creation that can either be a humanoid, alien, mythical being, or a wild creature. The traits that these craetures have may include:
Name
Species
Type/Race
Genetically Mutated
Natural Born Powers
Superpowers
Age
Sex
Sexuality
Gender
Experiances
Personality
Ideology
Place of Origin
Diet
Threat Level
Element
A custom version of these creatures is also available through textboxs that the user may fill in. A clear button is available to remove the current set character.
